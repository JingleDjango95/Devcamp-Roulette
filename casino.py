# requirements
# Build the game.
# Push individual commits to github.
# In addition,
# the player will have a wallet, they can add money to the wallet, any winnings they get will be added to the wallet.
# If the wallet goes empty they must add more money or they have to stop playing.
# They need to be able to stop playing and cash out the wallet at anytime. (bonus if the cash out proccess tells them if they made a profit or not)
# let the player set the dollar/cents amount of the bet (in the game).
# let them continue playing as long as they have money or decide to cash out.
